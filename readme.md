# US Flights Delays for 2007
## by Mohamed Ibrahim

## Dataset
> The dataset contain all the domestic US flights in 2007. There were also other lookup data sets for carriers and airports but for this analysis i didn't need to include it. The plan i had in mind was to explore if there is a relationship between the flight date/time and flight delays. I wanted to know if there are a certain date/time that an average traveller would expect delays more than another date/time. I decided to study only one year as the data was big to study all years and would affect processing time. The questions that i planned to answer was the following:
> - Is there a relationship between the travelling month/day of month/day of week and the number of delayed flights?
> - Is booking a flight in the morning have an effected on expected delay than booking an evening flight ?

## Summary of Findings
> - There is no clear relationship between the number of delayed flights and the month of the flights, however, the summer months have more delayed flights than winter months
> - There is no clear relationship between the number of delayed flights and the day of the week or the day of the month. There is a slight upward trend in the percentage of delayed flights to on-time flights from Tuesday to Friday. Friday is the highest day in terms of percentage of delayed flights out of all flights
> - Evening passengers should expect higher chanes of delays and also longer delays than morning passengers.
> - The highest average delay per flight is for passengers travelling from 1 am to 3 am


## Key Insights for Presentation
> Always try to choose morning flights as there is lower chance that you will get a delay and also lower delay periods
